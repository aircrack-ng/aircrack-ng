=== Compilating ===

If you're not compiling aircrack-ng on Linux, first, you have
 to delete Makefile
 * cygwin  : rename Makefile.cygwin to Makefile
 * MacOSX  : rename Makefile.osx to Makefile
 * windows : use windows package unless you don't need airodump/wzcook
 * FreeBSD : rename Makefile.FreeBSD to Makefile
 * OpenBSD : rename Makefile.OpenBSD to Makefile
 * NetBSD : rename Makefile.NetBSD to Makefile
 * On another OS: That's untested, but you have to rename Makefile.other to Makefile

Compilation:
 make

REM:
 * You can find a WPA handshake capture and a dictionnary in "test" directory
 * If you have trouble compiling and you get align errors with sha1-mmx.S
   (src/sha1-mmx.S:20:Alignment too large: 15. assumed.), remove line 20
   (it contains ".align(16)" ) then recompile

You can strip debug informations from executables before
installing them with:
 make strip


Installing:
 make install


Uninstall:
 make uninstall


=== Using precompiled binaries ===

Linux/BSD:
 * Use your package manager to download aircrack-ng
 
Windows:
 * Install the appropriate "monitor" driver for your card (standard drivers doesn't work for capturing data)
   See "Drivers" page on the wiki: http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=drivers and 
   Wild packet driver page: http://www.wildpackets.com/support/downloads/drivers
 * Download cygwin1.dll, msvcr70.dll, peek.dll and peek5.sys that you can find on the wiki
   download page ("more downloads..." link) and put them in the directory you extracted the
   executable files.
 * aircrack-ng suite is command line tools. So, you have to open a commandline
   (Start menu -> Run... -> cmd.exe) then use them
 * Run the executables without any parameters to have help

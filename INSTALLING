== Building ==

=== Requirements ===

 * Autoconf
 * Automake
 * Libtool
 * shtool
 * OpenSSL development package or libgcrypt development package.
 * Airmon-ng (Linux) requires ethtool.
 * On windows, cygwin has to be used and it also requires w32api package.
 * On Windows, if using clang, libiconv and libiconv-devel
 * Linux: LibNetlink 1 or 3. It can be disabled by passing --disable-libnl to configure.
 * pkg-config (pkgconf on FreeBSD)
 * FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris and OS X with macports: gmake
 * Linux/Cygwin: make and Standard C++ Library development package (Debian: libstdc++-dev)

=== Optional stuff ===

 * If you want SSID filtering with regular expression in airodump-ng
   (-essid-regex) pcre development package is required.
 * If you want to use airolib-ng and '-r' option in aircrack-ng,
   SQLite development package >= 3.3.17 (3.6.X version or better is recommended)
 * If you want to use Airpcap, the 'developer' directory from the CD/ISO/SDK is required.
 * In order to build besside-ng, besside-ng-crawler, easside-ng, tkiptun-ng and wesside-ng,
   libpcap development package is required (on Cygwin, use the Aircap SDK instead; see above)
 * For best performance on FreeBSD (50-70% more), install gcc5 (or better) via: pkg install gcc7
 * rfkill
 * For best performance on SMP machines, ensure the hwloc library and headers are installed. It is strongly recommended on high core count systems, it may give a serious speed boost

=== Installing required and optional dependencies ===

Below are instructions for installing the basic requirements to build
`aircrack-ng` for a number of operating systems.

Note: CMocka should not be a dependency when packaging Aircrack-ng.

==== Linux ====

===== Debian/Ubuntu =====

    `sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libtool pkg-config libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev libssl-dev ethtool shtool rfkill zlib1g-dev libpcap-dev libsqlite3-dev libpcre3-dev libhwloc-dev libcmocka-dev`

===== Fedora/CentOS/RHEL =====

    `sudo yum install libtool pkgconfig sqlite-devel autoconf automake openssl-devel libpcap-devel pcre-devel rfkill libnl3-devel gcc gcc-c++ ethtool hwloc-devel libcmocka-devel`

==== FreeBSD ====

    `pkg install pkgconf shtool libtool gcc7 automake autoconf pcre sqlite3 openssl gmake hwloc cmocka`

==== OSX ====

XCode, Xcode command line tools and HomeBrew are required.

    `brew install autoconf automake libtool openssl shtool pkg-config hwloc pcre sqlite3 libpcap cmocka`

==== Windows ====

===== Cygwin =====

Cygwin requires the full path to the `setup.exe` utility, in order to
automate the installation of the necessary packages. In addition, it
requires the location of your installation, a path to the cached
packages download location, and a mirror URL.

An example of automatically installing all the dependencies
is as follows:

    `c:\cygwin\setup-x86.exe -qnNdO -R C:/cygwin -s http://cygwin.mirror.constant.com -l C:/cygwin/var/cache/setup -P autoconf -P automake -P bison -P gcc-core -P gcc-g++ -P mingw-runtime -P mingw-binutils -P mingw-gcc-core -P mingw-gcc-g++ -P mingw-pthreads -P mingw-w32api -P libtool -P make -P python -P gettext-devel -P gettext -P intltool -P libiconv -P pkg-config -P git -P wget -P curl -P libpcre-devel -P openssl-devel -P libsqlite3-devel`


===== MSYS2 =====

    `pacman -Sy autoconf automake-wrapper libtool msys2-w32api-headers msys2-w32api-runtime gcc pkg-config git python openssl-devel openssl libopenssl msys2-runtime-devel gcc binutils make pcre-devel libsqlite-devel`

=== Compiling ===

To build `aircrack-ng`, the Autotools build system is utilized. Autotools replaces
the older method of compilation.

NOTE: If utilizing a developer version, eg: one checked out from source control,
you will need to run a pre-`configure` script. The script to use is one of the
following: `autoreconf -i` or `env NOCONFIGURE=1 ./autogen.sh`.

First, `./configure` the project for building with the appropriate options specified
for your environment:

    `./configure <options>`

TIP: If the above fails, please see above about developer source control versions.

Next, compile the project (respecting if `make` or `gmake` is needed):

 * Compilation:

    `make`

 * Compilation on *BSD or Solaris:

    `gmake`

Finally, the additional targets listed below may be of use in your environment:

 * Execute all unit testing:

    `make check`

 * Installing:

    `make install`

 * Uninstall:

    `make uninstall`


====  `./configure` flags ====

When configuring, the following flags can be used and combined to adjust the suite
to your choosing:

* with-airpcap=DIR:  needed for supporting airpcap devices on windows (cygwin or msys2 only)
                Replace DIR above with the absolute location to the root of the
                extracted source code from the Airpcap CD or downloaded SDK available
                online. Required on Windows to build besside-ng, besside-ng-crawler, 
                easside-ng, tkiptun-ng and wesside-ng when building experimental tools.
                The developer pack (Compatible with version 4.1.1 and 4.1.3) can be downloaded at
                https://support.riverbed.com/content/support/software/steelcentral-npm/airpcap.html

* with-experimental: needed to compile tkiptun-ng, easside-ng, buddy-ng, buddy-ng-crawler,
                    airventriloquist and wesside-ng. libpcap development package is also
                    required to compile most of the tools.
                    If not present, not all experimental tools will be built.
                    On Cygwin, libpcap is not present and the Airpcap SDK replaces it.
                    See --with-airpcap option above.

* with-ext-scripts: needed to build `airoscript-ng`, `versuck-ng`, `airgraph-ng` and 
                   `airdrop-ng`. 
                   Note: Each script has its own dependencies.

* with-gcrypt:   Use libgcrypt crypto library instead of the default OpenSSL.
                And also use internal fast sha1 implementation (borrowed from GIT)
                Dependency (Debian): libgcrypt20-dev

* with-duma:	Compile with DUMA support. DUMA is a library to detect buffer overruns and under-runs.
            	Dependencies (debian): duma

* disable-libnl:  Set-up the project to be compiled without libnl (1 or 3). Linux option only.

* without-opt:  Do not enable stack protector (on GCC 4.9 and above).

* enable-shared:   Make a OSdep a shared library.

* disable-shared: When combined with enable-static, it will statically compile Aircrack-ng.

* with-avx512:  On x86, add support for AVX512 instructions in aircrack-ng. Only use it when
                the current CPU supports AVX512.

* with-static-simd=<SIMD>: Compile a single optimization in aircrack-ng binary. Useful when compiling
                    statically and/or for space-constrained devices. Valid SIMD options: x86-sse2,
                    x86-avx, x86-avx2, x86-avx512, ppc-altivec, ppc-power8, arm-neon, arm-asimd
                    Must be used with --enable-static --disable-shared. When using those 2 options, the default
                    is to compile the generic optimization in the binary. --with-static-simd merely allows
                    to choose another one.

===== Examples =====

  * Configure and compiling:

    `./configure --with-experimental`
    `make`

  * Compiling with gcrypt:

    `./configure --with-gcrypt`
    `make`

  * Installing:

    `make install`

  * Installing (strip binaries):
  
    `make install-strip`

  * Installing, with external scripts:

    `./configure --with-experimental --with-ext-scripts`
    `make`
    `make install`

  * Testing (with sqlite, experimental and pcre)

    `./configure --with-experimental`
    `make`
    `make check`

  * Compiling on OS X with macports (and all options):

    `./configure --with-experimental`
    `gmake`

  * Compiling on OS X 10.10 with XCode 7.1 and Homebrew:

    `env CC=gcc-4.9 CXX=g++-4.9 ./configure`
    `make`
    `make check`

    *NOTE*: Older XCode ships with a version of LLVM that does not support CPU feature
    detection; which causes the `./configure` to fail. To work around this older LLVM,
    it is required that a different compile suite is used, such as GCC or a newer LLVM
    from Homebrew.

    If you wish to use OpenSSL from Homebrew, you may need to specify the location
    to its' installation. To figure out where OpenSSL lives, run:

    `brew --prefix openssl`

    Use the output above as the DIR for `--with-openssl=DIR` in the `./configure` line:

    `env CC=gcc-4.9 CXX=g++-4.9 ./configure --with-openssl=DIR`
    `make`
    `make check`

  * Compiling on FreeBSD with better performance

    `env CC=gcc7 CXX=g++7 ./configure`
    `gmake`

  * Compiling on Cygwin with Airpcap (assuming Airpcap devpack is unpacked in Aircrack-ng directory)

    ```
    cp -vfp Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/airpcap.dll src
    cp -vfp Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/airpcap.dll src/aircrack-osdep
    cp -vfp Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/airpcap.dll src/aircrack-crypto
    cp -vfp Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/airpcap.dll src/aircrack-util
    dlltool -D Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/airpcap.dll -d build/airpcap.dll.def -l Airpcap_Devpack/bin/x86/libairpcap.dll.a
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure --with-experimental --with-airpcap=$(pwd)
    make
    ```

== Packaging ==

Automatic detection of CPU optimization is done at run time. This behavior
**is** desirable when packaging Aircrack-ng (for a Linux or other distribution.)

Also, in some cases it may be desired to provide your own flags completely and
not having the suite auto-detect a number of optimizations. To do this, add
the additional flag `--without-opt` to the `./configure` line:

`./configure --without-opt`

== Using precompiled binaries ==

=== Linux/BSD ===

* Use your package manager to download aircrack-ng
* In most cases, they have an old version.

=== Windows ===

 * Install the appropriate "monitor" driver for your card (standard drivers doesn't work for capturing data).
 * aircrack-ng suite is command line tools. So, you have to open a commandline
   `Start menu -> Run... -> cmd.exe` then use them
 * Run the executables without any parameters to have help

=== Directories ===


manpages: contains aircrack-ng manpages
patches: contains linux driver patches
packages: contains file to create distro packages.
src: contains the aircrack-ng suite sources
test: contains several different WPA handshake and other capture files
      as well as a dictionnary

=== Compilating ===

If you're not compiling aircrack-ng on Linux or FreeBSD, first, you have
 to delete the original Makefile then:
 * cygwin  : rename Makefile.cygwin to Makefile
 * MacOSX  : rename Makefile.osx to Makefile
 * windows : use windows package unless you don't need airodump/wzcook
 * OpenBSD : rename Makefile.OpenBSD to Makefile
 * NetBSD : rename Makefile.NetBSD to Makefile
 * On another OS: That's untested, but you have to rename Makefile.other to Makefile

	Compilation:
	  make


	Installing:
	  make install


	Uninstall:
	  make uninstall


Optionnaly, you can strip debugging symbols by running 'make strip' before 'make install'

=== Compiling with airpcap support ===

See README_AIRCAP.TXT

=== Using precompiled binaries ===

Linux/BSD:
 * Use your package manager to download aircrack-ng
 
Windows:
 * Install the appropriate "monitor" driver for your card (standard drivers doesn't work for capturing data)
   See "Drivers" page on the wiki: http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=drivers and 
   Wild packet driver page: http://www.wildpackets.com/support/downloads/drivers
 * If you use airodump-ng, peek.dll and peek5.sys files are needed (they have to be put in the same directory
   as airodump-ng). You can either download them (there are links on our wiki) or let airodump-ng download
   them itself the first time you run it.
 * aircrack-ng suite is command line tools. So, you have to open a commandline
   (Start menu -> Run... -> cmd.exe) then use them
 * Run the executables without any parameters to have help
